# Academic & Research Roadmap

## Academics
- Maintain a high CGPA
- Don’t go with the flow
- Focus on your long-term goal (more important than what you did)

## Skills & Experience
- Start gaining domain knowledge early
- Join clubs (for learning + networking)
- Participate in competitions
- Do projects and showcase them (aim to be champions)
- Use innovation lab support
- Solve real problems — and solve them well
- Every day, write down the problems you face

## Research
- Do research consistently
- Read research papers
- Note down potential supervisors
- Research professors’ profiles
- Keep contacting professors (professionally)
- Seek a mentor in 8th or 9th semester
- What you did matters less than *why* and *where you want to go*

## Applications & Planning

- Each university has a different SOP
- Look into exchange programs
- Check CS rankings and university rankings
- Be consistent and disciplined (“cranking”)
